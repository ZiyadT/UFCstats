UFC Fighter Stats GUI

## Description

A GUI that fetches UFC Fighter Stats from the official UFC website. Uses a web scraper and displays the scraped info with a picture of the fighter.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* BeautifulSoup4 (pip install bs4)
* Python's inbuilt tkinter library for GUI design

### Installing/Execution

* Just download the files to the same folder and run either ufc.py or test.py
* After you run the program, enter the name of the fighter you would like to receive stats for. For example if I wanted to receive stats for Max Holloway, I would type in "Max Holloway"

### FYI's

* ufc.py is the GUI I had designed initially, most of it is hard-coded so the formatting might be compromised if it isn't run on a 1920x1080 resolution screen (make sure your screen scale is 100%)
* test.py was created to fix the issue ufc.py was having, but problems kept popping up so I decided to take a break and work on other projects
* If anyone can help me out in fixing this formatting issue, I would be very grateful!
